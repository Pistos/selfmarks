SelfMarks is anti-social bookmarking for the technically endowed.
Trouble-free bookmarking for geeks.  Bookmarking with you taking all the credit (and blame).
Bookmarking without the centralization handcuffs.

Can't figure out how to
<span id="git-get">

<a href="http://github.com/Pistos/selfmarks/tree/master" id="get_">get</a>
</span>
SelfMarks and install it yourself?  Then SelfMarks is not for you[r admin].

Tired of waiting for the servers of third-party social bookmarking sites
when you don't even use the "social" part?  Then SelfMarks is for you.
