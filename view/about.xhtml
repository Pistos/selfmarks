SelfMarks is anti-social bookmarking for the technically endowed.
Trouble-free bookmarking for geeks.
Bookmarking without the centralization handcuffs; you take all the credit (and blame).
</p>

<p>
Can't figure out how to
<span id="git-get">
<a href="http://github.com/Pistos/selfmarks/tree/master" id="git_">git</a>
<a href="http://github.com/Pistos/selfmarks/tree/master" id="get_">get</a>
</span>
SelfMarks and install it yourself?  Then SelfMarks is not for you[r admin].
</p>

<p>
Annoyed with the speed and uptime of the servers of third-party social bookmarking
sites when you don't even use the "social" part?  Then SelfMarks is for you.
